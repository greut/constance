A clojure library offering constant time comparison functions, to avoid timing attacks.

## Usage

You'll need to get the following artifacts:

```
[org.spootnik/constance "0.5.2"]
```

```clojure
(constant-string= "foo" "bar")
;; false
(constant-string= "foo" "foo")
;; true
(constant= (.getBytes "h") (.getBytes "a"))
;; false
```
